# Dumpster Crawl

A fork of DCSS that aims to ruin the game in every way I can think of without making the game crash every 3 seconds (maybe just 5).

## Features

Work in progress, there's no release yet so this is just a list of things I've done so far.

### Modified Species

**Ogre**

I fixed ogres guys, now all they can do is smash shit with clubs. You're welcome.

### New Species

**Swamp Ogre**

They're like vanilla crawl ogres except a little more exciting. They get rPois, rCorr, and the ability to fart out poison clouds. If all of that sounds like I just made naga v2.0 then you're probably right, but I did it for shrek.

### New Enemies

**Swamp Ogre** _(Incomplete)_

They're like the playable species version. They spawn in swamp sometimes. That's about it.
Eventually they'll do more than be slightly more annoying ogres, but I'm lazy and want to work on other things first.

### Other Shit

+ Merged Short Blades and Long Blades into Blades. Stabby blades still stab better, only rapiers riposte.
+ Merged Bows and Crossbows into Archery. Having a skill for two whole weapons that nobody uses is fucking dumb (I'll probably change slings too at some point, and you probably won't like it).

Crawl uses the following open source packages; thanks to their developers:

* The Lua scripting language, for in-game functionality and user macros ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/lualicense.txt)).
* The PCRE library, for regular expressions ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/pcre_license.txt)).
* The SQLite library, as a database engine ([license](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html)).
* The SDL and SDL_image libraries, for tiles display ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/lgpl.txt)).

Thank you, and die (in-game tho).
