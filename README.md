# Dumpster Crawl

A fork of DCSS that aims to ruin the game in every way I can think of without making the game crash every 3 seconds (maybe just 5).

## License and history information

Crawl is licensed as GPLv2+. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full text.

Crawl is a descendant of Linley's Dungeon Crawl. The final alpha of Linley's Dungeon Crawl (v4.1) was released by Brent Ross in 2005. Since 2006, the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup team has continued development. [CREDITS.txt](crawl-ref/CREDITS.txt) contains a full list of contributors.

Crawl uses the following open source packages; thanks to their developers:

* The Lua scripting language, for in-game functionality and user macros ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/lualicense.txt)).
* The PCRE library, for regular expressions ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/pcre_license.txt)).
* The SQLite library, as a database engine ([license](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html)).
* The SDL and SDL_image libraries, for tiles display ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/lgpl.txt)).
* The libpng library, for tiles image loading ([license](crawl-ref/docs/license/libpng-LICENSE.txt)).

Thank you, and die (in-game tho).
